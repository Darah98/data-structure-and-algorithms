# Hashtables

a hash table which is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

## Challenge

challenge requires creating four methods to add a ll to the hashtable, get a ll from the hashtable, check if a certain key is in the hashtable as well as hash a given value.

## Approach & Efficiency

Approached this challenge by creating a node class, a linkedlist class and a hashtable class that all together can create a hashtable with different methods that can manipulate this type of data structure.
