## Hashmap LEFT JOIN
LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.

## Challenge
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
